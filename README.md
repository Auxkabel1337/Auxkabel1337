    Hey there! 👋 I'm Auxy, a passionate software developer who loves to explore new technologies and build amazing things. I have a strong interest in solving complex problems and continuously enhancing my skills. While I may be new to the coding scene, I'm enthusiastic and dedicated to learning and growing every day.

   - 🌱 Currently, I'm diving deep into Java and working on various projects to sharpen my skills.
   - 🚀 Graduated high school recently, and I'm excited to take my programming journey to the next level.
   - 🎮 When I'm not coding, you might find me exploring my interests, which extend beyond the world of chess (not a big fan, sorry!).

   Let's connect and learn from each other! Feel free to reach out.
